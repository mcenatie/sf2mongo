# Salesforce to MongoDB using StrongLoop

This project can be used to one-way synchronize data from Salesforce to a MongoDB database. StrongLoop is used to connect to MongoDB and compose/expose a REST endpoint that can be consumed by Salesforce. You can configure Salesforce to trigger outbound messages to this endpoint based on specific rules (e.g. when a new account is created, updated...).

Demo video and instructions will come soon...
